# Sekimeiya-Regex

A mod that lets you use regular expressions when using the in-game search function of The Sekimeiya: Spun Glass.

### Installation

1. **Back up all saves before using this!!**
2. Copy `zscreens_search.rpy` into the `/game` directory.
3. You need to copy the `/game/scripts/gui/00viewport2.rpy` file into the `/game` directory or else you'll get an error.

### Known issues

It doesn't work with curly brackets: `{}`

I assume the original code has some logic that strips them from the string, and I didn't remove that yet.
